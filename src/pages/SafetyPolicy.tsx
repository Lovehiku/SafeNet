          <strong>2. Detection & Awareness Tools</strong><br />
          SafeNet provides tools to analyze text, screenshots, and profile images
          to detect potential harassment, threats, grooming, hate speech, and
          impersonation. These tools are intended for awareness and evidence
          documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Reporting & Evidence</strong><br />
          Users are encouraged to save alerts and evidence when harmful content
          is detected. This information can help users make informed decisions
          and support reporting to trusted organizations or authorities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. No Tolerance for Abuse</strong><br />
          SafeNet does not tolerate the misuse of its platform to harass,
          threaten, exploit, or harm others. Any abuse of the system may result
          in restricted access.

          <strong>5. Emergency & External Support</strong><br />
          SafeNet is not an emergency service. In cases of immediate danger,
          users should contact local emergency services or national support
          helplines. SafeNet may guide users toward appropriate support resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>6. Continuous Improvement</strong><br />
          This safety policy may be updated to reflect improvements in safety
          practices, user feedback, or evolving digital risks. Continued use of
