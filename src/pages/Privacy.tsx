          <strong>4. Data Storage & Security</strong><br />
          Reasonable measures are taken to protect stored data from unauthorized

          <strong>6. User Rights</strong><br />
          You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of
          your stored data. Requests can be made by contacting the SafeNet team.
